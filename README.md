Dear Kamil, today you've learned new interesting things...

Day 1

Now I know how to print "Hello World!" in many different ways. In go, everything is based on packages. I can create my own types.
I'm aiming to be able to create my own performant REST API using Go. I bought Udemy courses to introduce myself into this beatiful language. Cya tomorrow!
